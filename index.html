<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I received Ph.D. degree of Computer Science at Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html">Xia Ben Hu</a>.
<!--   I am currently on the job market looking for full-time ML scientist/engineer. -->
  I currently work in Microsoft as a machine learning engineer, focusing on recommendation systems and retrieval augmentated generation (RAG).
  I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon in Fall 2021, working on automated video generation for video ads with Dr. Chu Wang.
  Moreover, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft in Summer 2021, working on constrained hyperparameter optimization with Dr. Chi Wang.
  My current research interests are <b>Defect Detection</b>, <b>Hyperparameter Optimization</b>, <b>Neural Architecture Search</b>, <b>Distribution System</b>, and <b>Label Noise</b>.</p>
<p>Before that, I obtained M.S. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2015. My advisor was Dr. <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hungsh/">Shih-Hao Hung</a>.</p>
